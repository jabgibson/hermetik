# h7k
Don't roll your own crypto

## What is this?
project name: `hermetik`

I had a thought one day. It's not profound I don't think, but it
did cause me to lay awake thinking. If I took a slice of bytes and
randomly scramble each of those bytes, would there be any way to
descramble them without knowing the amount each byte was shifted?

I asked Grok what it thought, and Grok said [it is near impossible to decrypt.](https://grok.com/share/84fca72f-496d-41e5-a3b8-a16d8d77976b)
So.. yeah I spent a few nights working on it, and this is what I came up with.

I get a lot of negativity from morons saying *"Don't try and reinvent the wheel"*. Please
don't read into this project here as an attempt to write a profound
new cryptography algorithm. I am not reinventing the wheel. 

This project is not cryptographic. Now I know more than I used to on what happens
when you shift bytes around, and I don't regret it.

### Why the 7?
Originally, I was using h6k as a numeronym for the 6 characters
in between `h` and `k`, in the original name of this project `hermetik`.
When I realized I was going to rename it, and decided I liked the number
7 better, I just said "heck, why does it matter?" and went with a 7 as
part of the name.
