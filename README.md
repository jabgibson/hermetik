Don't roll your own krypto

## what is this
Yeah I wrote this up real quick just testing
some ideas I was thinking, and I usually
don't commit that kind of stuff publicly.
But.. this time, I did. What I have found
so far is that idea is kind of a cool
byte shifter library. I have no use case
for something like this, but every time I write
a few more lines of code, something else clicks.

I might add some tests now, and eventually rewrite
this README with something more valuable.
